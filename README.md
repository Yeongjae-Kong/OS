• Xv6’s command prompt only shows “$”

• Bash’s command prompt is more complex. Add Username, Hostname and Current working directory.

Objectives of this project

• Find the system-call table and register your own system-call number

• Implement your own system-call

• Understand how the kernel-space and the user-space exchanges data

---------------------

### pj1

1. Implement a simplified CFS and EEVDF scheduler in the xv6. Modify the default xv6 scheduler to a CFS and EEVDF scheduler.

Objectives of this project

• Understand how context-switches are performed in xv6 code

• Implement a CFS scheduler

• Implement a EEVDF scheduler based on the CFS scheduler

--------------------

### pj2

1. Implement a inverted page table in the xv6. Modify the default paging scheme (multi-level paging) to inverted page table.

Objectives of this project

• Understand How multi-level paging are performed in xv6 code

• Implement a inverted page table
